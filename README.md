# Image-Recognition-and-Classification-Device-for-Blind-People

**Project idea is to implement an image recognition and classification device in spectacles of blind people, so that it can recognize and classify the things(visuals) in front of them. It also helps to identify the people in front of them with the help of face recognition.**

**This device will help to identify, recognize and classify the things in front of them using Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick(NCS) with Raspberry Pi-3.**

**The project is developed till its image recognition and classification process, and I'm under developing its classified image text to speech process so that Blind people can know what is in front of them through their earphones connected to the device.**
With the help of Intel Movidius NCS we can run any complex pre-trainet Networks in the processors with low processing capability.
This NCS functions as an efficient external processor for performing any complex neural architectures.

**Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick(NCS)** can be used as an **external GPU** for the systems which cannot support for artificial intelligence based projects.
They are less-cost comparing other GPU's and can be used efficiently for most of the Deeo Learning, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Based Projects 

### Goals of this project:
- **To reduce the difficulties faced by the blind people by creating a device which can recognize and classify what is in front of them(inclusing identifying people in front of them using Face recognition)**
- **And to convert the classified and recognized image into speech so that they can listen to it can interact with their surrounding easily.**

### Hardware component required for this projects:

- **Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick(NCS) 2**
- **Raspberry pi-3**
- **Raspberry pi-camera**

### Required Softwares:

- **Python**
- **OpenVino Tool Kit**
